# gender_paygap_analysis
The hypothesis testing conducted on Spark Fortress Inc. aimed to determine the presence of a gender pay gap. The sample was divided based on gender, and a t-test for independent samples was used, assuming equal population variance. Additionally, further categorization was done based on age, distinguishing employees below 35 and those aged 35 and above.

The conclusion drawn from the analysis suggests that, overall, there is no gender wage gap in the company. This outcome is primarily driven by wage equality among younger employees. However, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations in the study, such as the omission of position as a variable and the potential influence of other factors, like ethnicity, which were not accounted for in this particular analysis.
